# Temporal
Time and Date Display Utility for macOS Menubar

This is a small utility program which stays in the menubar and displays a clock and calendar in a drop down.

# Settings

* Time can be set to be displayed in 12 hour or 24 hour format
* Users can select one of 3 themes for the clock and calendar
    * Night - a dark theme
    * Daylight - a light theme
    * Rainy - a theme with subtle colors denoting a rainy day (except for the purle :) )
